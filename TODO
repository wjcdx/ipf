# TODOs:
1. Establishing a TCP server on public ip address to avoid TCP RST to client,
   but contents should be dropped. Because it's already relayed via raw socket.
   A: Deprecated.
      Just use iptables to close the TCP port, which means DROP packets to the TCP port.
	  $ iptables -A INPUT -d 192.168.1.1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

2. Establishing a TCP client on camera ip address immediately after a TCP SYN
   is received from a client, because TCP SYN is not relayed. And the TCP
   source port should be recorded for packets NAT later.
   A: Deprecated.
      We maybe have to adjust all tcp header fields, it's too complicated.

3. For TCP stream, when a packet need downstream forward, we should learn src ip & mac.
